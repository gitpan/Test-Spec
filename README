Test::Spec
==========

This is a declarative specification‐style testing system for behavior‐
driven development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a. examples) are named
with strings instead of subroutine names, so your fingers will suffer
less fatigue from underscore−itis, with the side benefit that the test
reports are more legible.

This module is inspired by and borrows heavily from RSpec
(http://rspec.info/documentation/), a BDD tool for the Ruby programming
language.

See `perldoc Test::Spec` for syntax examples and usage information.
